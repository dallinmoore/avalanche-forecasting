# Avalanche Forecasting

The following is built upon my original web scraper [here](https://github.com/dallinmoore/utah_avy_webscraping).

The project started by gathering data on avalanches in Utah through the [Utah Avalanche Center](https://utahavalanchecenter.org/) for a Tableau dashboard. Now, the data is being used alongside SNOTEL data to build and deploy a model that can generate a danger forecast for the next day.

More details coming! This project is still under development.
